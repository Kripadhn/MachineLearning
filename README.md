# MachineLearning-CNN

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are a type of deep learning model that are particularly well-suited for image recognition. They consist of multiple layers of convolutional filters that extract features from an image, and are trained to classify images based on those features. Here is an example of a simple CNN implemented in Python using the Keras library:
